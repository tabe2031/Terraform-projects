#To Debug terraform, we use LOG and set an environmental variable as {TF_lOG=TRACE}. this will enable us to see detailly the processes runned by terraform.
         and
         if we intend to export the logs we are gathering to help us debug out of the environment of our terraform resource, we run {TF_LOG_PATH= path to where we intend to store the logs for later reviewing]
